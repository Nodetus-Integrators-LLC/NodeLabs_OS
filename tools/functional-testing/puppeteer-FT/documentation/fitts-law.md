# Metrics for Fitts' Law

## Movement Time (MT)
The time it takes for a user to move the cursor to a target.

## Distance (D)
The distance from the starting point to the target.

## Target Width (W)
The width (size) of the target.

The formula for Fitts' Law is typically represented as:

\[ \text{MT} = a + b \cdot \log_2\left(\frac{D}{W} + 1\right) \]

where:

- \( a \) and \( b \) are constants that depend on the specific conditions of the test.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) or Benchmarks

### Movement Time (MT)
The time it takes for a user to move the cursor to a target element and click it. Shorter times indicate better usability.

### Click Accuracy
The accuracy with which users can click on the target elements. Higher accuracy indicates better usability.

### Effective Width and Distance
The calculated effective width of the target elements and the distance from the starting point. These should align with the ease of interaction.

### Throughput (TP)
A measure that combines movement time and accuracy, often used to summarize the efficiency of user interactions. Higher throughput indicates better usability.

### User Satisfaction
Subjective feedback from users on how easy and intuitive the interactions feel. Higher satisfaction scores indicate better usability.
